      During my studies for the COMPTIA Security+ certification, I came across
      something called Metasploit. Metasploit is described as a computer
      security project that provides information about security vulnerabilites,
      aids in pentesting and IDS (intrusion detection system) signature
      development.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      My interest in the field of cyber security has been mainly on the blue
      team but I figured it is always a good opportunity to learn and this
      seemed pretty interesting. As such, I went to work learning about
      Metasploit the only way I know how - downloading the application and
      poking around.
    </div>
    <div class="heading">Installation</div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      The
      <a
        href="https://docs.metasploit.com/docs/using-metasploit/getting-started/nightly-installers.html"
        >Metasploit Wiki</a
      >
      suggested I install on Linux. I jumped at the opportunity - this allows me
      to fire up a virtual machine, which is always fun. Once I got through the
      copy-pasting of installation commands, we were ready to go. The start-up
      screen was funny and nerdy - kinda what I was expecting.
    </div>
    <div class="caption">
      <img src="metasploit_images/landing.png" alt="pic1" id="post__img" />
      Kinnnddaaa funny, I suppose. Think I'm definitely missing an inside joke.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      My exposure to Metasploit extends to getting a question about it wrong in
      a past paper, and that's it. But that's why we do these things :).
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      The first tip informed me that Search can apply complex filters such as
      search cve:2009 type:exploit.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">And so I typed in search cve:2009 type:exploit.</div>
    <div class="caption">
      <img src="metasploit_images/search.png" alt="pic" id="landscape__img" />
      Results of my first search on Metasploit
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      The resulting search appeared to be a list of vulnerabilities along with
      some details about them. In order to go into a bit more granular detail, I
      chose a vulnerability (one that was ranked excellent, as we don't settle
      for anything less on this blog) and typed in info [#].
    </div>
    <div class="caption">
      <img src="metasploit_images/search.png" alt="pic" id="landscape__img" />
      A bit more detail about my chosen vulnerability
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      We appear to be dealing with the Symantec Center Alert Management System
      Arbitrary Command Execution. This alert management system is prone to a
      remote command-injection vulnerability because the application fails to
      properly sanitise user-supplied input. Let's break down a some of the
      terminology from this description:
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      Remote command-injection: As mentioned previously, incorrectly sanitised
      user input can cause a system to do something unwanted. In this case, it
      allows a remote command-injection. This allows the attacker to execute a
      command within the system - naturally something the administrator would
      want to avoid.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      Reading through this description, I also realised that Metasploit is not
      providing a list of vulnerabilities. It takes this a step further and
      provides a list of exploits. Exploits take advantage of vulnerabilities.
      This struct me as being a little more sinister. Of course, these are to be
      used in pentesting and it is important that this sort of information is
      publically available for testing purposes. But it still felt a little...
      evil.
    </div>
    <div class="heading">Conclusion</div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      This was a brief introduction to Metasploit. All I really did was download
      it, run a simple search function and go into a bit more detail on one of
      the exploits provided. However, this was powerful in of itself - to have
      access to this sort of information within a few taps of the keyboard was
      pretty daunting. I think Metasploit has a lot more to offer and I am
      excited to share these features with you once I have learned them myself.
