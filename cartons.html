    <div class="heading">Context</div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      For a job interview, I was required to solve for the following problem: a
      customer orders a certain number of koolaid bottles. These bottles come in
      cartons that have specific sizes. Our deliveries can make use of any
      number of these cartons and the goal is to deliver the order either:
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      completely, using the available carton sizes or as close to but less than
      the order order using the carton sizes provided
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      This reminded me of the coin problem - given coins of various
      denominations, determine whether you can make up a given total (and to
      extend the problem: find the least number of coins required to do so).
    </div>
    <div class="heading">Implementation</div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      The first requirement would be to discard any invalid totals: negative
      numbers, 0 or any number less than the lowest denomination of coin.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      Similarly, all coin denominations needed to be natural numbers.
    </div>
    <pre class="green">
      <code class="js">
        if not ((order &gt;= 1) and (isinstance(order, int))):
          return "Invalid order size"
        if not (all(isinstance(item, int) for item in avail_carts)):
          return "Carton size must be a whole number"
        if not (min(avail_carts) &gt;= 0):
          return "Invalid carton sizes"
        if order &lt;= min(avail_carts):
          return min(avail_carts)
      </code>
    </pre>
    <div class="paragraph">
      These exceptions ensure that the inputs to our function are correct.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      The next step is the actual algorithm. Note that this solution is
      incorrect. I dwelled on how to do this problem for a while but kept
      thinking of problems in my solutions. I need to choose between checking
      the solution online and coming up with my own, incorrect solution. Seeing
      as this was for an interview, I did not want to misrepresent my coding
      ability and hence opted for the latter option. This, at least, I would be
      able to explain in an interview if asked about my decisions (rather than
      just taking someone else's correct work).
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      Thus I tackled the problem my way and hoped this would get across how I
      thought about the problem. I envisioned a matrix where all the possible
      multiples of the various carton sizes would be included. For instance, if
      our order size was 24 and our carton sizes were 3 and 2, then the matrix
      produced would be
    </div>
    <pre class="green">
      <code class="HTML">
        [[ 3  6  9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30 33 36]
        [ 2  4  6  8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24]]
      </code>
    </pre>
    <div class="paragraph">
      This kind of array manipulation took a long time - my main coding
      background has been in Matlab. Although numpy in Python is fairly similar,
      that fact took me a while to find out and a lot of context-switching
      needed to take place (after discussion with my more computer-science
      inclined brother, I was informed that I was 'shaving yaks').
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      My vision for the program would be that the algorithm would be able to
      select a single number from each row (or 0) and sum combinations of these
      to find either the order number or the highest possible combination of
      carton multiples.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">The issue with this algorithm was that</div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      I did not know how to implement the 'choosing' bit and the 'highest
      possible combination' bit involved an optimization problem, which I also
      did not know how to do
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      Unfortunately I was strained for time for the submission and needed to
      come up with the best alternative. For me, that was order the matrix from
      the highest carton size to the lowest. Then to iterate through the matrix,
      either selecting the highest multiple from the row (and adding this to the
      total) or moving to the next row and doing the same. This solution was
      okay - it would work well for when orders were perfect multiples of one of
      the carton sizes. It would also work if the order could be comprised of
      mostly carton of the largest size (as the highest number of these would be
      selected first.) Unfortunately it did not allow for any kind of real
      nuance - i.e. if the order could be achieved by being made up of 1 carton
      of the largest denomination and 3 cartons of the smallest denomination -
      this would not work.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      This algorithm is what I submitted. Again, it was not correct, but I
      deemed it more important to get across how I approached the problem rather
      than getting the right answer at all costs.
    </div>
    <div class="heading">Second Chance</div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      One of the developers at the hiring company got back to me, saying that
      they liked my code and wanted to give me a second shot at completing the
      problem. They also requested that I implement some testing of the function
      (rather than the rudimentary print(MY_ANSWER) I was using.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      The implementation of the tests looked like the following:
    </div>
    <pre class="green">
      <code class="js">
        class TestNum(unittest.TestCase):
          def test_num_koolaids1(self):
              self.assertEqual(20, num_koolaids(20, [2, 4]))

          def test_num_koolaids2(self):
              self.assertEqual(25, num_koolaids(25, [2, 3]))
      </code>
    </pre>
    <div class="paragraph">And so on for various known inputs and answers.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      I then needed to embark on the issue at hand: submitting the correct
      answer this time. I figured my thinking needed a bit of a shift and hence
      tackled the problem diagrammatically. I drew out a couple of scenarios and
      how I wanted my algorithm to step through the problem to get to the
      solution.
    </div>
    <div class="caption">
      <img src="cartons-images/working.jpg" alt="pic1" id="post__img" />
      Algorithm is supplied with 18 as an order and 6 and 3 as carton sizes.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      The above would see that 18 is larger than the largest size of carton and
      so would evaluate the function with 12 as the order size (order -
      max(carton_list)). Still, order > max(carton_list) so the step is
      repeated. Now, order = carton_list[0] and so we can return that carton
      size. This repeats all the way up, with the carton sizes being added back
      along the way, until 18 is returned to the function (i.e. the complete
      order size can be fulfilled using three cartons of size 6 each.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      I realised immediately that I had drawn out the bane of my first-year
      computer science existence: a recursive function. Once I got over my
      initial fear, however, I found the solution to come rather easily. One big
      factor in this was being able to do away with numpy and just use lists, so
      the notational context switching was reduced a lot. I simply implemented
      for increasingly difficult cases: when the order cannot be made up
      perfectly, when the order can be made perfectly but the smaller carton
      denomination needs to be used, when multiple of the smaller cartons need
      to be used and so on, progressively adding new cases.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      By iteratively adding to the complexity of the algorithm, I found my code
      to become far more clean and simple. Past redundancies were removed as I
      needed to generalise to broader cases. The final solution looked as
      follows:
    </div>
    <pre class="green">
      <code class="js">
        def num_koolaids(order, avail_carts):

          avail_carts.sort(reverse=True)

          if order == avail_carts[0]:
              return avail_carts[0]
          if order > avail_carts[0]:
              return avail_carts[0] + num_koolaids(order-avail_carts[0], avail_carts)
          else:
              if len(avail_carts) == 1:
                  return 0
              else:
                  return num_koolaids(order + avail_carts[0], avail_carts[1:]) - avail_carts[0]
      </code>
    </pre>
    <div class="paragraph">Essentially, the algorithm executed as follows:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">&gt; Sort the list of cartons into descending order</div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      &gt; Check if the order matches the largest denomination size: if so, return
      that denomination size
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      &gt; If the order was greater than the largest denomination, call the function
      again but with the new 'order' being the current order size less the
      largest cart denomination
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      &gt; If the order size is less than the largest carton denomination, the
      function is called using the second-largest carton denomination
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      &gt; If none of this is possible (i.e. We are down to our final carton
      denomination), return 0
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      This solution worked reliably for inputs and answers given.
    </div>
    <div class="heading">Lessons learned.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      &gt; Diagrams are very useful for visualising how an algorithm should work
      (Particularly for recursive formulas)
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      &gt; Always implement testing from the very beginning
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      &gt; It is effective to solve for smaller problems and iterate your
      solution, adding complexity each time
