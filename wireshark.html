    <!-- Services Section -->
    <div class="paragraph">
      I have begun venturing into the exciting world of cyber security, and have
      recently received my COMPTIA Network+ certification. Of course, there is
      no better way to get to know something than through experience and hence I
      wanted to go through a packet capture in order to test my understanding of
      networking (and perhaps teach the reader a thing or two).
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      The application I used for the capture was Wireshark. Wireshark is a
      free-to-use protocol analyser and essentially allows you to see what's
      going on in your network.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      Once Wireshark was downloaded, I selected `Wi-fi' as the interface of
      choice.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">Click Enter:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      Immediately the logs begin to fill and I click Stop after about three
      seconds, still enough time for about 30 packets to be captured. I was a
      little surprised by this as I did not have any browser tabs open, or any
      other applications for that matter. I selected a packet at random to
      analyse.
    </div>
    <div class="caption">
      <img src="wireshark-images/row.png" alt="pic1" id="post__img1" />
      Packet captured by Wireshark
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      Let's go through the packet column-by-column to see what we're working
      with.
    </div>
    <div class="heading">No.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      This is simply the number of the packet, started from the beginning of the
      packet capture. So when we hit `capture' initially, the first packet that
      was captured would have been no.1, the second would have been no.2 and so
      forth.
    </div>
    <div class="heading">Time</div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      This the time taken from the beginning of the packet capture. As you can
      see, we were only 2s in to the capture and were already on the 21st
      packet!
    </div>
    <div class="heading">Source</div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      This is the IP address of the source of the packet. I have blanked out the
      final two bytes, but this was in the usual format in which we expect to
      find IP addresses: XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX, where each byte is a positive integer
      between 0 and 255.
    </div>
    <div class="heading">Destination</div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      Ditto to above, except applying to the destination address.
    </div>
    <div class="heading">Protocol</div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      This refers to the protocol the packet uses for transport. In this case,
      we have TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). TCP is a reliable protocol,
      meaning that the sender is notified when the packet is received. The other
      transport protocol taught in the Network+ curriculum is UDP (User Datagram
      Protocol). Glancing at the Wireshark logs, I can also see TLS, SSDP and
      IGMP protocols. (Transport Layer Security, Simple Service Discovery
      Protocol and Internet Group Management Protocol, respectively.)
    </div>
    <div class="heading">Length</div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      The `length' refers to the number of bytes of the frame captured, in this
      case 60. The frame is the length of the payload of the packet. This does
      not represent all the data contained in the entire packet, as things such
      as encryption and headers will add to the total amount of data in the
      packet.
    </div>
    <div class="heading">Info</div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      This column was, for me, the most difficult to decipher. The `info' reads:
    </div>
    <pre class="green">
      <code class="HTML">
        443 -&gt; 49876 [ACK] Seq=1 Ack=1 Win=15872 Len=0
      </code>
    </pre>
    <div class="paragraph">
      The first two numbers are ports - this is evident from the 443 port, which
      is well-known (HTTPS). I had not seen 49876, but a quick speedguide did
      not have this port listed.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      [ACK] refers to the second flag in the TCP handshake process whereby a
      device aknowleges a [SYN] flag requesting the establishment of a
      connection to a server. This is also tied to Seq = 1 : if we start
      counting from 0, SYN is the 0th step in the TCP handshake sequence, ACK is
      the 1st.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      Ack = 176 refers to the 176th ACK number in the relative ACK sequence.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      Win = 15872 refers to the calculated window size. This is the amount of
      data (in bytes) that can be received in a buffered connection.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      Len = 0 means that the packet had no payload. One device was merely
      informing another about something. In this case, sending through an ACK.
    </div>
    <div class="heading">Inference</div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      From this we can infer the packet captured was an exchanging of an ACK
      flag to initiate a connection. There was no payload for the packet. The
      source port was 443, the HTTPS port. The destination port was an unknown
      open port on the host device.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      It is rather frightening, incredible, exciting and a little terrifying the
      amount of information available on each packet of information that passes
      through a network.
    </div>
